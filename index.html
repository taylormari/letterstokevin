  <title>letters to waky</title>

		dear waky,
</p>
I wanted to write you letters in a website because I don’t really know what I’m trying to tell you, just give you an update on how I feel. 
<p></p>
I’ve been thinking about you romantically for the past few days. When you said you were meeting someone new friday night, it immediately sobered me, which is best. I’m easily wrapped up in my unrealistic dreams whereas you seem to be facing reality with more clarity. There are some thoughts that have been helping me recover though. 
<p></p>
realistic thoughts: <br>
everything I already explained in my letter on faith
we probably don’t share values (I am honestly quite conservative when it comes to drug use, as you possibly guessed)
I process things slowly, and you told me how painful this is for you
we really weren’t that fun most of the time, we’re both so heavy
<p></p>
random:<br>
did you wonder what I was thinking / notice when I kissed your eyes (in LA)?
I was praying that God would let you see things clearly. 
<p></p>
when I wrote: ‘thanks for fucking with my head, come again soon’ in my journal, I was referring to the lyrics in ‘Ending of Dramamine’ by csh.

I want to drink tomorrow, if I can get over myself ; I’m twenty f-ing two man. (talking to no one, perhaps a character from “financial life of poets”) I’m still terribly romantic and naive. I don’t know whether anyone could handle me in a relationship anyways. I hope they would, but, judging from my and Kay’s friendship, there will be terribly real barriers and things that shouldn’t be taken personally but will strike us right in the heart. Blaming is devastating. I still struggle with blaming myself for every screw up, since I tend to idolize others easily. 
For now, I am letting myself escape into fantasy land and watching korean dramas while my responsible family gets rest for SAT prep and work. I feel my loneliness levels increase drastically, but maybe they’ll finally break my inhibitions and I’ll try a dating app.

W paid one dollar to the bartender and couldn’t find the white ball. Borrowing the one on the adjacent table, the bartender threw it into a corner socket, hitting the other which was stuck inside and both rolled down to the bottom. W kept glancing at me as he circled the table, and I kept smiling awkwardly. I told him I wasn’t used to such staring, but he replied with an unfortunately non-romantic excuse, that he was unsure I was having a good time. Apparently my smile seemed defeated and uncertain, afterall, I was not succeeding at the game and I didn’t know what to talk about. At first I’d just stare at the ball long enough for him to help me, being indecisive and self-conscious. He told me to have just “a moment of focus” , and helped me choose which shots to attempt. But soon, he was on his last ball, and repeatedly couldn’t get it in, and grew quiet. I focused on making decisions for myself again, slowly ending up clearing the table. After I’d got the 8-ball in, I told him how it all made sense, my character - you think I’m losing, don’t know what I’m doing, everything misplaced and diasporate like a messy kitchen, but gradually, you see how my actions come together and sometimes surprise you and myself. 	I’m certain it meant something about him too. On the shore, W ventured out into the water - regardless of the stingray warning. I didn’t have swim shorts on. I stayed in a small circle of an area, picking up sand and clams with my feet.<p></p></i>
